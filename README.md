# Sign-Language-Detection

Object Detection with fine-tuned YOLOv8 with Sign Language dataset. The dataset I used is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daskoushik/sign-language-dataset-for-yolov7)

## Content
1. `training.ipynb`: used for fine tuning the model.
2. `inference.ipynb`: specific for inference only either for data test, or external new data.
3. `checkpoints/`: best model's weights
